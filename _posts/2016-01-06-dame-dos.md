Dame Dos is like a [Dame](/basics/dame) except the leader skips over a partner to the right, ending up two
partners down (hence the "Dos"). 

In Ithaca, we use a variation where the Catante calls Dame, then on 1,2,3 (when the leader 
just has his hand on the followers back), calls Dame Dos.  The leader sorta completes the Dame
by sending the partner to the left, but then skips a partner and does another Dame with the 
_third_ follower down.  The combined effect is skipping two partners and ending on the third.  This
variation has more momentum than a plain ol' Dame Dos from [Guapea](/basics/guapea), which feels too accelerated
from a stop.  

A slight variation is Dame Dos Con Dos, which adds two claps on the second count 7,8.

Translation
:  Gimme Two

Sign
: Sign for Dame, then sign for "two" (or peace sign)

Resembles
: [Dame](/basics/dame)

Notice in this video there are three couples.  Since Dame plus Dame Dos effectively skips two
partners, the leaders always end up with the follower they started with.  

## Breakdown

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
| (Dame!) 1 - 1,2,3 | Same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) | Same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) |
| - 5,6,7 | Same as Guapea but when you're hands meet, give a little extra push and let go, leaning over to the right for your next partner | Same as Gupea but left arm up |
| (Dame Dos!) 2 - 1,2,3 | Same as [Dame](/basics/dame) | Same as [Dame](/basics/dame) |
| - 5,6,7 | Same as Dame but walk, walk, walk to SKIP the next partner | Same as Dame, but left arm up again |
| 3 - 1,2,3 | Same as Dame | Same as Dame |
| - 5,6,7 | Same as Dame | Same as Dame |


Notes
:  Leaders often have to rush to skip a partner, so make your steps long and swift in that portion.  A 
cruel and unusual Cantante may call Dame Dos again on the third 1,2,3, and maybe even a fourth time. 
Just keep walkin' my friends ... keep walkin'.
