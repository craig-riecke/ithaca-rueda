Dame is the easiest and most popular partner-changing move.  In Rueda, 99% of the time the
_leader_ moves to a new partner on the _right_.  The follower stays put.  And Dame is a no-frills
way to do just that.  

The core of Dame is two moves: Picalante and Dile Que Non.  For Picalante the leader goes 
forward (the opposite of his Guapea), while the follower moves backward (the same as her Guapea). There's
just a little bit of tension here when you do it because you're moving in different directions.
If you dance Salsa, you'll recognize the Dile Que Non - it's the basic Cross-Body Lead.  

Picalante and Dile Que Non are also used to end other moves where you don't change partners,
such as [Hecho](/from-the-tap/hecho) or [Three-Way Stop](/from-the-tap/three-way-stop).

Dame is sometimes called Dame Una to distinguish it from [Dame Dos](/basics/dame-dos), with 
the "Una" or "Dos" meaning how many partners the leader skip (counting from the one you're 
with now).

## Breakdown

Generally Dame starts on the 5,6,7 of a Guapea

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
| 1,2,3 | Same as Guapea | Same as Guapea |
| 5,6,7 | Same as Guapea but when you're hands meet, give a little extra push and let go, leaning over to the right for your next partner | Same as Gupea but left arm up |
| (Picalante) Beat 1 | Forward with left - same foot as Guapea but different direction | Back with right |
| 2 | Replace right foot | Replace left foot |
| 3 | Left foot together  | Right foot together |
| 4 | (Pause) At this point, your hand should be on follower's left shoulder. | (Pause) |
| (Dile Que Non) 5 | Left foot replace, with your left hand, catch her right hand | Walk in front of leader with left foot |
| 6 | Right foot replace | Turn to your left while stepping on your right.  You should be past the leader |
| 7 | Left foot replace | Keep turning to your left as you step into place beside new leader |
| 8 | (Pause)  You are now in position for a Gaupea | (Pause) |

Notes
: The follower's step on Picalante is a little easier if on 4, you pull your left foot into your right, called a "collect" because you're collecting your center of gravity.  On the five you will step out with that left foot.  Dile Que Non 5,6,7 is "walk-turn-turn".  At the end, you should be facing the exact
same way you did at the beginning, and so it's a full 360 degree turn.  It will feel fast at
first, but will be second nature after awhile.
