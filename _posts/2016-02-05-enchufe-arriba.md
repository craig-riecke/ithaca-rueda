Enchufe Arriba starts like [Enchufe](/enchufe/enchufe) but the leader goes for the follower
on the left instead of the right.  If you think of most Rueda change partner moves as going
downstream (counter-clockwise), this is just going upstream (clockwise).  

Translation
: Plug in Above

Sign
: Enchufe sign, then point upstream (which will be either left or right depending where you
are in the circle.  Just move in the direction the Cantante is pointing.)

Resembles
: [Enchufe](/enchufe/enchufe), [Adios Arriba](/adios/adios-arriba)

Note in the video it's unclear how Enchufe Arriba is different since it's only two followers
and you end up with the same partner.  

## Breakdown

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
|1 - 1,2,3 | Same as [Enchufe](/enchufe/enchufe), but don't turn toward connected partner | Same as [Enchufe](/enchufe/enchufe) |
| - 5,6,7 | Walk, Turn, Turn to the left.  Be on the left of the upstream partner | Same as [Enchufe](/enchufe/enchufe), Arm Up |
| 2 - 1,2,3 | [Picalante](/basics/dame) | [Picalante](/basics/dame) |
| - 5,6,7 | Dile Que Non | Dile Que Non |

Notes
: Getting on the left hand side of the upstream follower requires speed.  Step lively!
