Adios Arriba starts like [Adios](/adios/adios) but the leader goes for the follower
on the left instead of the right.  If you think of most Rueda change partner moves as going
downstream (counter-clockwise), this is just going upstream (clockwise).  

Translation
: Goodbye, Above

Sign
: Adios sign, then point upstream (which will be either left or right depending where you
are in the circle.  Just move in the direction the Cantante is pointing.)

Resembles
: [Adios](/adios/adios), [Enchufe Arriba](/enchufe/enchufe-arriba)

Notes
