Enchufe Complicado has many regional variations.  Ours looks a lot like [Adios Con La Hermana](/adios/adios-con-la-hermana)
with a Mechanismo Interior, which is just an extra enchufe with a J-Hook turn.  It looks really nice and
can be danced in Salsa.  

Translation
: Plug In Complicated

Sign
: Enchufe sign, then spin index finger at temple (the Complicado sign)

Resembles
: [Enchufe Doble](/enchufe/enchufe-doble), [Adios Con La Hermana](/adios/adios-con-la-hermana)

Notes
:  This variation seems to have originated in Syracuse with Brian Bromka.  He also coined the 
term Mechanismo Interior, which shows up in other moves like [Sententa Cubana](/setenta-setenta-cubana).
