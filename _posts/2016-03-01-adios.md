In an Adios, you first do an open break, but then you snap to closed position.  The leader and
follower spin around, then the leader "tosses" the hand of the follower over the shoulder and
heads over to the next follower (the one on the right, as usual).  

For the leader, Adios is the first move you learn with a Hook Turn.  Lots of Rueda moves have a
hook turn in them, 99% of the time for the leader.  

Translation
:  Goodbye!

Sign
: Wave goodbye

## Breakdown

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
|1 - 1 | Step back with your left foot, which is the opposite of a [Guapea](/basics/guapea)  | Step back with your right, same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) |
| - 2 | With your right foot, step ahead a little to the left | |
| - 3 | Step together, now in closed position with right hand on her back | |
| - 4 | (Pause) | (Pause) |
| - 5 | Do a hook turn while raising your left hand | Walk forward on your right |
| - 6 | Continue to turn | Walk forward on your left |
| - 7 | Let go of hand.  That's the Toss | Walk forward on your right |
| - 8 | (Pause) | (Pause), Left arm up |
| 2 - 1,2,3 | [Picalante](/basics/dame) | [Picalante](/basics/dame) |
| - 5,6,7 | Dile Que Non | Dile Que Non |

Notes
:  I like to think of Adios as "Hello, Goodbye".  The closed position is "Hello", then the toss of the
hand is "Goodbye".  It is a fickle and non-monogamous move indeed!
