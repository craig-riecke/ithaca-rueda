Una Bulla is like a "[Suenela](/basics/suenela) with your mouth".  Instead of stomping on count 5, all dancers
shout "Hey!" and raise their free hand.  

Translation
: One Noise

Sign
: Hand starts at heart, then comes out of mouth like your vomitting.  Bluggh.  

Resembles
: [Suenela](/basics/suenela)

This group does not raise their hand, and their "Hey!" is a feeble.  When you Una Bulla,
yell it like you mean it!

## Breakdown

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
|1 - 1,2,3 | Same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) | Same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) |
| 5,6,7 | Same feet as Guapea, but raise free hand on 5 and yell Hey! | Same as leader |

Notes
:  Sometimes we call "Slow Bulla" which is a "Hey!" that lasts through 5,6,7, getting louder as
it goes and punctuated with a ! on 7.
