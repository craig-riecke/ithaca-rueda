Enchufe Con Giro is just an [Enchufe](/enchufe/enchufe) with an extra twist for the leader.  When the leader is walking
past their current follower, they do a complete 360 degree turn to the left before picking up the
next follower.  There's nothing different for the follower.

Notes
:  Sometimes in an ambitious mood, the Cantante will call Enchufe Con Giro Festival, which is three
Enchufe Con Giro's in a row.  ("Festival" generally means "do three of these" in Rueda)  Not used
to so many turns, the leaders will get dizzy, guaranteed!
