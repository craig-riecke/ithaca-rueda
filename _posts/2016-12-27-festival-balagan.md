Festival Balagan is [Enchufle]({{ "/enchufle/enchufle" | absolute_url }}), 
one clap, Enchufle Doble, two claps, and Enchufle "triple", then
three claps.  Some groups call the triple an Enchufle Complicado, but it's not like the one
we do.  

Translation
: Festival "Disorder" - Festival moves are "three of something", and Balagan is actually a Hebrew word.

Notes
: For the leader the tough part here is clapping after the enchufle "triple" because you somehow have 
to clap AND get your hand on the follower's back in one count.  It helps a little to 
"wash" your hands by brushing them up and down instead of straight clapping - it's a smidge
softer, but faster.
