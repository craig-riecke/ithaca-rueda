Dame Y No Le Llegues starts with a [Dame](/basics/dame), but the leader changes his mind and goes back to
original follower.  

Both the leader and followers use the V-step, which is a basic step used in other Rueda moves 
like [Vaciala](/from-the-tap/vacilia).  In the V-Step, you end up moving to the left or 
right while maintaining the same direction of your body.  It's a good general move to get
the hell out of someone's way!  

Translation
: Gimmme, but don't arrive

Sign
: Sign for vacilia, sign for "no-no-no" (shake index finger)

Notes
: Non-Spanish speaking Canantes have a hard time pronouncing this.  Just cram it all together: Dame
No-ee-yeg-ah.  Think (Manuel) Noriega, without the "r".
