Adios Con La Hermana (mostly called as "Adios Hermana") is the first four counts of [Adios](/adios/adios) with an
[Enchufe Complicado](/enchufe/enchufe-complicado) grafted on the end.  Unlike Adios, you don't change
partners. 

Translation
:  Goodbye to your sister!  Maybe your sister is better than you, since the leader doesn't leave her.

Sign
: Adios, then a palm up at chest level 

Resembles
: [Adios](/adios/adios), [Enchufe Complicado](/enchufe/enchufe-complicado)
