Notes
: For the leader the tough part here is clapping after the enchufle "triple" because you somehow have 
to clap AND get your hand on the follower's back in one count.  It helps a little to 
"wash" your hands by brushing them up and down instead of straight clapping - it's a smidge
softer, but faster.
