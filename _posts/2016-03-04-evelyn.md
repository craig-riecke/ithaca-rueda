Evelyn seems like an [Adios](/adios/adios), but instead of ducking under the follower's left arm, the leader
does a hook turn in place keeping the hand low and switching hands.  It's quick and elegant.

Evelyn has a [Una Bulla](/basics/una-bulla)-style "Hey" in there.  Leaders are _required_ to yell Hey!, followers may do it
if the spirit moves them.  (In Ithaca, we hang loose).  In general, moves where the leaders move
into the center and have the left arm free like [Hecho](/from-the-tap/hecho) have a "Hey!"
to keep things lively.  It's always called on 1.  

Translation
:  Nobody knows who Evelyn is.  She might be related to Roberto of Roberto Complicado fame.

Sign
: An "E" with thumb, index finger, middle finger
