Suenela, sometimes called Suena, gets the Rueda circle back on the beat.  It's like a Gaupea,
but on the 5,6,7 instead of meeting together, you stomp with your outside foot (for the leader,
the right, for the follower the left).  If all goes well, you all stomp on 5 and rings like
a resounding bell across the dance floor.  If it doesn't, it sounds like clattering train 
wreck and the Catante usually calls it again until people are all together.  

Translation

Level
: Beginner

## Breakdown

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
|1 - 1,2,3 | Same as Guapea | Same as Guapea |
| 5,6,7 | Stomp with right on 5, then pause | Stomp with left on 5, then pause |

Notes
:  We usually just keep doing Suenelas until the Catante calls something else.  It's popular
to do Suena La Fly to break it up.  Most groups do one Suenela and go back to Guapea if nothing
else is called.
