[Dame](/basics/dame) is a quick way to switch partners, but Enchufe is more fun.  And Enchufe is 
used a lot in Rueda - sometimes as the core of the move like 
[Enchufe Complicado](/enchufe/enchufe_complicado), sometimes in the middle
like [Setenta Cubana](/setenta/setenta_cubana). 


Translation

Level

Notes
:  Enchufe is sometimes spelled "enchufle".  A popular variation in our group, which we picked 
up from Syracuse, is for the leader to sweep their right arm over the top of their head almost
like pitching a baseball on the first 5,6,7.  It looks cool ... if you don't hit her!  So watch it.
