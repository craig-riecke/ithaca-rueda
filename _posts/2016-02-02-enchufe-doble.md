Enchufe.

Notes
:  For styling, the followers in group generally put their left hand up on 7 when they're cuddled in.
The tricky part is not hitting the leader's face in the process.  If you start with your hand at
your heart, then twist it by your ear, then up to the air, that naturally keeps your elbow in
so that doesn't happen.
