excerpt: The basic step of Rueda - back on the outside foot, forward on the inside foot.
categories: Basics

Guapea is the default move in Rueda.  If no move has been called, or you don't know a 
move that has been called, or you're too tired/dizzy ... or maybe you just don't want 
to do the move that was just called, do a Guapea!  Don't just stand there!

When you start a Guapea, the leader is on the right, the follower is on the left.  You
hold your inside hands (the leader's left, the follower's right).  In Rueda you almost 
always do called moves with this partner, so Guapea establishes this relationship.  

For the follower, Guapea is almost exactly like the default salsa step: backward-on-the-right,
forward-on-the-left.  For the leader, it's the _opposite_ of the default salsa step: 
backward-on-the-left, forward-on-the-right.  

Translation
:  Looks Good!

Level
: Beginner

Sign
: None.  The Cantante does not call Guapea - you just do it when there's no clear move.

Your inside arms will follow your feet a bit - when your feet go backward, your hands will go backward
and when your feet go forward, your arms will go forward.

It's a little like walking and chewing gum at the same time, but you'll get the hang of it!
When you practice, get the steps down first - that's the important part.  Then practice
the handhold while doing the step.  

Notes
:  There are about 10 billion variations on Guapea, and different groups do it very 
differently.  One variation some people do is to use the left hand to pull the follower 
around a bit on 5.  Followers - if you feel that grip on your right hand, don't panic!  Just
keep your frame and follow your hand around and you'll be fine!
