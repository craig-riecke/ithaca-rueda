Suena La Fly is like [Suenela](/basics/suenela) but instead of going back into Guapea, you break apart and clap 
in the air on the next 1 (of 1,2,3).  You keep doing it until Catante calls Dame or some
other move.  

This can be called from [Guapea](/basics/guapea), but in our group it is mostly called after Suenela since
we repeat the stomps anyway.  

Translation
: High Fly (a bit of Spanglish here - think baseball not insects!)

Sign
: Point out to the air

Resembles
: [Suenela](/basics/suenela)

Note this group does a Fly without the Suenela.  But the clap is the same.  

## Breakdown

|Count     | Leader | Follower |
|----------+--------+----------|
|1 - 1,2,3 | Same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) | Same as [Guapea](/basics/guapea) |
| 5,6,7 | Stomp with right on 5, then pause | Stomp with left on 5, then pause |
|2 - 1,2,3 | Turn to the follower on the right and clap on 1 | Turn to the leader on the left and clap on 1 |
| 5,6,7 | Stomp with right on 5, then pause | Stomp with left on 5, then pause |

Repeat!  

Notes
:  Sometimes we call "Fly Dos" after one or a few Suena La Fly's.  A Fly Dos has claps on both
1 and 2.
