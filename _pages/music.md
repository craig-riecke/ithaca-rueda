# Music For Rueda Practice

Not all music, and not even all Latin music, is appropriate for dancing Rueda.  In general we look for:

- A beat that's about Rumba or Mambo speed: 80 - 95 beats per minute
- No strange time changes - the "one" often shifts in the middle of A Latin song where a measure
is cut in half.  
- A really pronounced beat, especially in the bass.  There can be other rhythms going on, but
the central beat should be easy to pick out.  

A lot of the music we play in Rueda is picked through trial and error.  Many of the songs
below came from Internet lists like [http://thesalsafoundation.com.au/10-best-salsa-songs-for-beginners-to-practise-to/].  They are listed
in BPM order, slowest ones first.  So when you're a beginner, the songs at the bottom are 
really good.  As you get better, you can work up to the faster stuff.  If you'd like
to use your own music, you can check BPM at [https://songbpm.com/]
